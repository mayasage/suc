      Emacs' help system is roughly divided into 3 parts:
      - The Info Manual (M-x info/C-h i): Ref = info-shortcuts.png
            C-h F <command> - Emacs will jump to the correct place in the info manual where the command is described.
      - Apropos (M-x apropos-command/C-h a): when you're not entirely sure what you're lookin' for. Example, C-h a word$.
            Commands:
                  - M-x apropos = The thermonuclear option. Display all symbols... variables, commands, functions.
                  - M-x apropos-command/C-h a = List only commands.
                  - M-x apropos-documentation/C-h d = Searches just the documentation.
                  - M-x apropos-library = Lists all variables and functions defined in a library. Useful when installing a new mode or package as it lists all the functions and variables defined in it.
                  - M-x apropos-user-option = Shows user options available through the Customize Interface. This is one way to get the symbol names of Customize options.
                  - M-x apropos-value = Searches all symbols with a particular value.
      - Describe: When you know what you're looking for.
            Commands:
                  - M-x describe-mode/C-h m = Displays the documentation for the major mode (and any minor modes also enabled) along with any keybindings introduced by said modes. The describe command looks at your current buffer.
                  - M-x describe-function/C-h f = Gives you the elisp function signature.
                  - M-x describe-variable/C-h v = Read up on what a variable does.
                  - M-x describe-key/C-h k = Describes what a key binding does. Remember that some keys come from major and minor modes and are not global. Therefore, you may get a different answer depending on the buffer in which you type the command.

Customize:
      M-x customize - Open the customize interface.
      M-x customize-<what> - Example, M-x customize-themes

Restarting Emacs:
      M-x eval-buffer - Evaluate the entire buffer you're in.
      M-x eval-region - Evaluates the region you have marked.
      *Some things won't be re-evaluated.

Escape:
      C-x C-c - End emacs.
      <ESC> <ESC> <ESC> - All purpose escape command. (When C-g doesn't work.)

Set as default editor:
      Create a script that start emacs with -nw flag:
    	#!/bin/sh
    	emacs -nw "$@"

Theory

Terminology:
      1. Key, Complete Key, Prefix Key, Invalid Key
            Key = A sequence of keyboard (or mouse) actions.
            Complete Key = One or more keyboard sequences. Example: C-d.
            Prefix Key = If the sequence of keys is not a complete key. Example: C-x.
            Invalid Key = If the key sequence is not recognized by Emacs at all.

      2. Universal Argument (C-u)
            - Used to alternate states.
            - C-u is a shorthand for the number 4.
                  C-u <char> = 4 times <char>.
                  C-u C-u <char> = 16 times <char>.
                  C-u <num> <char>/C-<num> <char>/M-<num> <char>/C-M-<num> <char> = <num> times <char>.
                  C-u <0-9>/C-<0-9>/M-<0-9>/C-M-<0-9> = Digit argument 0 to 9.
                  C--/M--/C-M-- = Negative argument.
                  M-d = Kills the word after point.

                  M-- M-d = Kills the word before point. (You just have to hold M and press -d.)
                  C-- M-d = <same> But you have to press C-- and then M-d.
                        The first one maintains tempo.
                        The second one breaks tempo.

      3. Emacs init.el
            Location: ~/.emacs.d/init.el

      4. Viewing & installing packages.
            a) Add this to your init.el:
                  (setq package-archives
                  '(("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                  ("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/")
                  ("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/")))

            b) M-x eval-buffer
            c) M-x package-list-packages - List packages from the above 3 repositories.

            M-x package-install <package name> - Shortcut to install if you know the package name.
